# 📄 Project Documentation: Career-Bot Technical Specs

## 1. Executive Summary
**Career-Bot** is a specialized backend service designed to optimize the job application process. It acts as an intelligence layer that sits between raw user input (Job Descriptions/Resumes) and Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal is to provide high-accuracy career advice while minimizing computational costs and token usage.

## 2. System Architecture & Data Flow
The application follows a modular "Request-Process-Response" pattern.



### Workflow:
1.  **Ingestion:** The FastAPI server receives text via the `/summarize-jd` or `/resume-tips` endpoints.
2.  **Validation:** The system checks for empty strings or malformed inputs.
3.  **Compression (The ScaleDown Layer):** * The raw text is sent to the `ScaleDownCompressor`.
    * Unnecessary linguistic "noise" is stripped away.
    * Crucial technical keywords and requirements are preserved.
4.  **Inference:** The optimized context is sent to the AI to generate summaries or career tips.
5.  **Delivery:** The final structured JSON response is sent back to the client.

## 3. Detailed Endpoint Specification

### `POST /summarize-jd`
**Purpose:** Converts lengthy, unstructured job postings into 5 actionable bullet points.
* **Input Type:** `Form-Data` or `JSON`
* **Key Logic:** Uses `rate="auto"` compression to handle high-volume text.
* **Output:** `{"summary": "..."}`

### `POST /resume-tips`
**Purpose:** Conducts a comparative analysis between a JD and a Resume.
* **Input Type:** Multi-part `Form-Data` (Required keys: `job_summary`, `resume_text`)
* **Key Logic:** Concatenates inputs into a single context window for the AI to "cross-reference."
* **Output:** `{"tips": "..."}`

## 4. Engineering Challenges & Solutions

### A. The "Copy-Paste" Problem (422 Errors)
**Challenge:** Users often copy text from LinkedIn or Indeed that contains hidden formatting characters, causing standard JSON parsers to crash.
**Solution:** Implemented **Hybrid Request Handling**. By using `python-multipart`, the API can process raw `Form-Data`, which is much more resilient to special characters than strict JSON.

### B. LLM Cost & Latency
**Challenge:** Sending 2,000 words of "Company Perks" to an AI is expensive and slow.
**Solution:** Integrated **ScaleDown.ai**. This reduced the average token count per request by approximately 30-40%, leading to faster response times and lower API overhead.



### C. Connection Reliability
**Challenge:** External AI services occasionally return `504 Gateway Timeouts`.
**Solution:** Implemented `async` handlers to ensure the main server thread never hangs, and added a structural foundation for future retry-logic loops.

## 6. Future Roadmap
* **V2.0:** Support for `.pdf` and `.docx` file uploads.
* **V2.1:** Integration of a "Match Score" percentage.
* **V3.0:** React-based frontend for a complete user experience.
